# Data analytics using the data from the on-demand food delivery company

The results of this learning project were:

- Provided the recommendations on how to improve the business & product based on the dataset.
- Based on the recommendations/insights, I outlined an experiment with a working hypothesis & success metrics to test the suggested product/business recommendation. 
- The implementation path was suggested for the change on a larger scale with operational challenges and risks that might come along the way
